Open the [Assignment 6 Jupyter Notebook](assignment6.ipynb) and follow the instructions.

Additionally, I have recorded a YouTube lecture available here https://youtu.be/v1vbLJmQ43E to provide some supplementary context and tips.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following command at the Terminal command line

```
python test.py
```

a status message of `OK` indicates that you have the correct solution.
